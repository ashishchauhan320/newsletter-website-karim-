                        <p>The Stock Newsletter provides the following ratings based on overall performance and risk of stock newsletters. Full reviews can be found on the individual pages for the respective publication. The tabulated results are for informational purposes only and are not meant to be be a recommendation. They are based on available information at the time of publication. The Stock Newsletter rating and reviews are based on what we feel are the 4 most important factors to evaluate: Performance, Risk, Subscriber Feedback and Reputation.</p>
                        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
